          This website is my U2 summative project. It is a website that
          showcases the history of technology in ancient Europe. With the time
          period ranging from roman times to ww2

        <h2>World War 1</h2>
        <p>
          For WW1, I will be talking about two topics, Weapons and trench
          warfare.
        </p>
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>
          Becuase of the addition of trench warfare new weapons had to be made.
          These weapons were made for proficency in trench warfare. Some of
          these weapons include machine guns, musterd/chemical gas, tanks, As
          well as towers to fire into the trenches.
        </p>
        <h3>Trench Warfare</h3>
        <p>
          Trench warfare was a new way of fighting, this imvolved digging
          trenches at the battle ground to make it harder for you to be hit by
          your opponenet. There was also a area called no man's land between the
          trenches which was very dangerous and hard to cross. This was party
          beacuse people would soak it in water and make it very muddy.

        <h2>Changes in Thinking</h2>
        <p>
          I have two topics for changes in thinking the printing press and the
          eltrical generater.
        </p>
        <h3>Printing Press</h3>
        <p>
          The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th
          century. It was a machine that could create copies of books this
          change eurpoe forever because the press let people who wernt insanly
          rich read books.
        </p>
        <h3>Electrical Generator</h3>
        <p>
          The first electrical generator was invented by Michael Faraday in the
          1820s. This "Fraaday disk" works by using a magnet to create a current
          in a wire by turning a handle.

      <section id="settingTheStageForConflict" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
        <p>
          For this topic I will be talking about the industrial revolution and
          the first steam engine.
        </p>
        <h3>Industrial Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          The industrial revolution was a time when machines started to take
          over the work that humans used to do. And forever changed the way
          industry worked.
        </p>
        <h3>First Steam Engine</h3>
        <p>
          The first steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in the 1712.
          This was very important because it turnd into things like cars,
          planes, and tanks. And made factorys in the industrial revolution more
          efficient.

      <section id="middleAges" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>
          For the middle ages I will be talking about trebuchets and their
          impacts on the middle ages. Trebuchets were a type of catapult that
          used a counterweight to launch a payload instead of tension like
          traditional catapults. They were invented in the 11th century and were
          used to launch heavy rocks over half a mile into a castle wall.
