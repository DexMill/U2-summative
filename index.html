        <h2>World War 1</h2>
        <p>
          For WW1, I will be talking about two topics, Weapons and trench
          warfare.
        </p>
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>
          Becuase of the addition of trench warfare new weapons had to be made.
          These weapons were made for proficency in trench warfare. Some of
          these weapons include machine guns, musterd/chemical gas, tanks, As
          well as towers to fire into the trenches.
        </p>
        <h3>Trench Warfare</h3>
        <p>
          Trench warfare was a new way of fighting, this imvolved digging
          trenches at the battle ground to make it harder for you to be hit by
          your opponenet. There was also a area called no man's land between the
          trenches which was very dangerous and hard to cross. This was party
          beacuse people would soak it in water and make it very muddy.
