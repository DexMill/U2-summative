          This website is my U2 summative project. It is a website that
          showcases the history of technology in Europe. With the time period
          ranging from Roman times to World War 2.

        <h2>World War 1</h2>
        <p>
          For World War 1, I will be talking about two topics, weapons and
          trench warfare.
        </p>
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>
          Because of the addition of trench warfare, new weapons had to be made.
          Some of these weapons include machine guns, mustard/chemical gas,
          tanks. As well as towers to fire into the trenches.
        </p>
        <h3>Trench Warfare</h3>
        <p>
          Trench warfare was a new way of fighting, this involved digging
          trenches at the battle ground to make it harder for you to be hit by
          your opponent. There was also a area called "no man's land" between
          the trenches which was very dangerous and hard to cross. This was
          party because people would soak it in water and make it very muddy.
        </p>

      <section id="changesInThinking" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Changes in Thinking</h2>
        <p>
          I have two topics for changes in thinking: the printing press and the
          electrical generator.
        </p>
        <h3>Printing Press</h3>
        <p>
          The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th
          century. It was a machine that could create copies of books this
          change Europe forever because the press let people who weren't rich
          read books. Because of this books became more popular and are now a
          staple of life today.
        </p>
        <h3>Electrical Generator</h3>
        <p>
          The first electrical generator was invented by Michael Faraday in the
          1820s. This "Faraday disk" works by using a magnet to create a current
          in a wire by turning a handle. This changed the world forever because
          people are still using electricity today.

      <section id="settingTheStageForConflict" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
        <p>
          For this topic I will be talking about the industrial revolution and
          the first steam engine.
        </p>
        <h3>Industrial Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          The industrial revolution was a time when machines started to take
          over the work that humans used to do. And forever changed the way
          industry worked. This affected Europe by making it so certain products
          were more widely accessible.
        </p>
        <h3>First Steam Engine</h3>
        <p>
          The first steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in the 1712.
          This was very important because it turned into things like cars,
          planes, and tanks. And made factories in the industrial revolution
          more efficient.

      <section id="middleAges" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>
          For the middle ages I will be talking about trebuchets and their
          impacts on the middle ages. Trebuchets were a type of catapult that
          used a counterweight to launch a payload instead of tension like
          traditional catapults. They were invented in the 11th century and were
          used to launch heavy rocks over half a mile into a castle wall. This
          invention demonstrated many physics properties still being used today.
